# Cash That Heals: Unconditional Transfers & Pyschological Wellbeing

A data storytelling project visualizing how various cash transfer models impacted psychological wellbeingâ€”especially among womenâ€”in a landmark Universal Basic Income study conducted in Kenya by GiveDirectly and researched by Haushofer & Shapiro (2017).

This interactive report distills academic research into a compelling, standalone HTML visualization, illustrating mental health gains across treatment arms and genders using z-score deltas and percentile translations.

## The Visual

- **Title**: *Cash That Heals*  
- **Subtitle**: *How unconditional cash shaped mental health, by gender and treatment group*
- **Insight**: Across all transfer types, **women experienced meaningful psychological gains**â€”underscoring cashâ€™s potential to support female mental health, even when not explicitly targeted.

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

The underlying dataset is from:

**Haushofer & Shapiro (2017)**  
*The Short-Term Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers to the Poor: Experimental Evidence from Kenya*  
Harvard Dataverse: [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/M2GAZN](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/M2GAZN)

### Processing steps:
- Extracted and filtered key variables from the source dataset
- Key variables include the wellbeing index z-scores by treatment group and gender
- Computed **the change or delta** in the wellbeing index z-scores
- Computed **percentile gains** from z-score shifts using the standard normal distribution
- Rounded and formatted all numeric outputs for visual clarity and hover interactivity

---

## Key Insight

A z-score change of **+0.25** corresponds to an approximate shift from the **50th to the 60th percentile** in psychological wellbeing. Many transfer groups achieved even higher improvements.
